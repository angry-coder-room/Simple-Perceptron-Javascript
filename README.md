Simple Perceptron (Single Neural Network) using JavaScript

In this project, there are two values in a tuple. eg. (x, o) or (x, x).

The first value is a random value generated by the programs and the role of neural network is to learn and predict the first value and display it in the second value.

For correct predictions or say if both values are identical, the data points is printed in "WHITE".
For wrong predictions or say for difference in values, the data points are printed in "RED".
(Just to make it more interactive)
